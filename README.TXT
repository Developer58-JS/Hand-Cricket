USER INSTRUCTIONS:

For those who do not know how to play hand cricket:

1. The first stage is called the toss. The user picks 'odd' or 'even' where the user inputs a number between 1 and 6. 
These are the runs that are possible to score in one ball of cricket.Once the number is chosen the Computer picks a number. 
The way toss works is that the sum of both your number and the computer number is taken and they check whether its 'odd' or 'even'. 
If it's even, the person who chose even wins and if it's odd, the person who chose odd wins.

2. Then the person who wins the toss choses to bat or bowl. The way the game works is that, each turn the user inputs a number (1 or 6).
If the users number is not equal to the computers number then it is added to the score, however, if its equal, then a wicket is lost.

3. This game follows the one wicket format, that is once you lose a wicket, your innings is over. So in the end, we see who has the most runs and
the winner is decided.
